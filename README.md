All buttons are cleanly aligned and color-coordinated to reduce friction for new users.

# 🔄 Pagination & Page Hierarchy

### Parent & Child Page Logic

- **Parent Pages**: Hubs like `Programs`, `Creative`, `Games`
- **Child Pages**: Standalone pages that return to parent via **← arrow** in top-left corner
- Every page has lock/unlock & ⋮ menu buttons in consistent positions

### Pagination Rules (Multi-Page Layouts)

- **First Page**: `[ 1 >` — inactive left, active right
- **Middle Page**: `< # >` — active both sides
- **Last Page**: `< # ]` — active left, inactive right
- **Single Page**: `[ 1 ]` — no arrows, standalone

---

## Navigation & Lock Logic:

- **Automatic page switching** takes you to the correct page when its corresponding window is active.

- Tap the page title to return to the **Default Page**.

- Lock 🔒 / Unlock 🔓 buttons toggle whether the tablet stays on a page.

- Arrows (`<`, `>`) move between multi-page sections.

| **⋮ Menu**              | Opens global Main Menu                    |
| **Page Title Tap**      | Returns to default Programs page          |
| **< / > Arrows**        | Navigate between linked pages in a series |
| **🔒 Lock / 🔓 Unlock** | Toggle automatic page navigation          |
