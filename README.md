# 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Import All Pages**

   - Select all pages from to the [Live Tool](https://gabriel-velez.github.io/GBE-Deck/) and import them into TouchPortal

2. **Customize to Your Setup**

   - Open any of the `Button List` pages (1–4) to explore categorized layouts:
     - Apps, Games, Web Tools, Creative Software
   - Use these lists to copy and paste buttons into your own custom pages or build custom buttons as needed.

3. **Link your buttons**
   - Replace each button’s action with your installed app’s executable or relevant script.

# 🗂 How It Works

- Each page folder has:

  - `Pages.tpz2` – your actual Touch Portal pages 🔒 locked and 🔓 unlocked

  - `Meta.json` – with `name`, `version`, `author`, `description`, `dependencies (optional)`, `screenshot (single or array)`

  - `Screenshot.png` – or more screenshots for carousel previews

  - Optional: `Icons/` for custom button icons

- The `generate-pages.js` script auto-scans everything and produces a clean `pages.json`.

- The site uses this file to dynamically show all pages + metadata.

# 🔄 Pagination & Page Hierarchy

### Parent & Child Page Logic

- **Parent Pages**: Hubs like `Programs`, `Creative`, `Games`
- **Child Pages**: Standalone pages that return to parent via **← arrow** in top-left corner
- Every page has lock/unlock & ⋮ menu buttons in consistent positions

### Pagination Rules (Multi-Page Layouts)

- **First Page**: `[ 1 >` — inactive left, active right
- **Middle Page**: `< # >` — active both sides
- **Last Page**: `< # ]` — active left, inactive right
- **Single Page**: `[ 1 ]` — no arrows, standalone

---

## Navigation & Lock Logic:

- **Automatic page switching** takes you to the correct page when its corresponding window is active.

- Tap the page title to return to the **Default Page**.

- Lock 🔒 / Unlock 🔓 buttons toggle whether the tablet stays on a page.

- Arrows (`<`, `>`) move between multi-page sections.

| **← Arrow**             | Return to parent page                     |
| **⋮ Menu**              | Opens global Main Menu                    |
| **Page Title Tap**      | Returns to default Programs page          |
| **< / > Arrows**        | Navigate between linked pages in a series |
| **🔒 Lock / 🔓 Unlock** | Toggle automatic page navigation          |
