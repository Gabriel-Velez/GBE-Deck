# 🤝 Contributing to GBE Deck

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

GBE Deck is built to be modular and expandable. You can contribute by creating new Touch Portal pages, icon sets, or layout enhancements.

---

## 🧩 What You Can Contribute

- **Touch Portal Pages** (`.tpz2`)
  - Layouts for creative tools, games, system utilities, niche programs, etc.
  - Submit both **locked** and **unlocked** variants if applicable
- **Screenshots**
  - Clean, dark mode screenshots showing your layout in action
- **Icons**
  - Consistent square format (preferably 256x256 PNG with transparent background)

---

## 🛠 Template Pages for Easy Layout

Included in the repo are **pre-built design templates**:

- Use them to start your layout with proper spacing and consistent button placement
- Clock, nav arrows, lock/menu buttons, and title text are already positioned
- Just copy a template and start populating buttons — no layout guesswork needed

---

## 🚀 How to Submit

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your `.tpz2` file, screenshot, and any icons to a new folder under `Pages/Contributions/`
3. Open a Pull Request with a short description of your layout
4. Alternatively, open a GitHub Issue and attach your page + screenshot there

## 🧼 Submission Guidelines

- Stick to GBE’s clean, uniform visual style (dark mode optimized)
- Use icons that match or visually complement the bundled set
- Name your files clearly (e.g., `FL_Studio.tpz2`)
- Take clean screenshots (ideally 1280x720 or 1920x1080)

Let’s build a better deck together. All contributions are welcome — thanks for being part of it!
